# Frontend Blob URL Fix

## Problem Identified
The frontend components were not properly using blob URLs directly from API responses. Instead, they were trying to transform already-perfect blob URLs through the image service, causing 404 errors.

## Root Cause
`SmartImageV2` component was always attempting to transform URLs through `transformImageUrl()` even when the source was already a blob URL from the API response.

## Solution Implemented
Updated `SmartImageV2` component to detect and use blob URLs directly without transformation:

```javascript
// If src is already a full HTTP URL (including blob URLs), use it directly
if (typeof src === 'string' && (src.startsWith('http') || src.startsWith('blob:') || src.startsWith('data:'))) {
  setCurrentSrc(src)
  return
}
```

## Components Affected
- **app/decks/page.jsx**: Uses `SmartImageV2` for deck and card images ✅ Fixed
- **components/Card.jsx**: Uses Next.js Image directly with API responses ✅ Already working
- **app/page.jsx**: Uses Next.js Image directly for spread images ✅ Already working

## How It Works Now
1. API returns deck/card data with blob URLs in `image` fields
2. `SmartImageV2` detects blob URLs (starting with https://) and uses them directly
3. No unnecessary transformation or fallback attempts
4. Images load directly from Vercel Blob storage

## Testing
- Deck images should now load properly from blob URLs
- Card images in decks should display correctly
- Spread images continue working as before
- Performance improved (no unnecessary API calls for transformation)

## Next Steps
Test the decks page to confirm deck and card images now load properly with blob URLs from API responses.
